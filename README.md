# iot-sandbox-flows
Nodered flows for an Internet-of-Things sandbox

This repo is intended to be cloned from within a Node-red installation that has the projects feature enabled.

With these Node-red flows installed, you can create an environment that makes it easy for people to collaboratively interconnect inputs and outputs of diverse devices, leveraging the power of Paretoanywhere and the Internet of Things.

It's expecially useful in an educational environment where you want students to be able to play with interaction possibilities without having to worry too much about the nuts and bolts of implementation.


# Installation

## Set up a Raspberry Pi or similar computer with Node-red and ParetoAnywhere

Using Raspberry Pi Imager, create an image of:
- Raspbian Lite, with ssh enabled
(more thorough instructions are at this link)

once you've logged into your Pi, run:

`ifconfig`

Note your IP address, you'll need it later :)
